I'm a law school widow. Been supportive housewife (taking on all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc) for the past four years as my husband worked full time, attended law school part time, juggled internships and tried to maintain a social life. He informed me last year that he would be quitting his job to study for the bar this summer. I didn't understand why until talking to other lawyers who explained how rigorous it is. I started saving for this period Also, did you go solo or with a group? Would you recommend going alone or with people.

So yesterday I very luckily got my hands on some gold bars for a festival (hard to come by in Aus). It was the most amazing experience of my life, just so incredibly different than 'pingers', they were energetic but not speedy and the euphoria and connection was otherworldly. Here's the summary of our day: 2:30 - arrive at festival, pretty damn tanked at this point, spend a bit of time dancing around the edge of the mosh, and just chilling with out matees 4:50 - Ta-ku starts (amazing artist).
