Fight takes place inside the house. I also removed 6 ghosts from the fight as they have no combat advantage and would easly be killed Off The fighters are The Torn Prince- peak high school athlete, armed with a baseball bat The Angry Princess- beautiful girl armed with knife The Great Child- armed with a fire axe he was able to cut his way through a circus full of people body count high The Hammer- armed with his black smith hammer.

Director: Steve Beck Writers: I'm new here, so hi guys! :) I started a horror movie review blog (finally) and my first review was on Thir13en Ghosts. I went through and created a photo album for each ghost of the Black Zodiac, consisting of the zodiac illustrations from the Arcanum, stills from the movie, behind the scenes shots, and I even went back and listened to F. Murray Abraham's narration for all of their back stories from the bonus features and wrote them down word for word and attached those to each album as well.
